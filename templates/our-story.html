    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>He went from avoiding social events to a full-blown social butterfly… all because he had to talk to one girl. Funny how love works.</p>

      <h2>How We Met</h2>
      <p>It all started when he was forced to talk to me on my second day of work. Don't worry,
        nothing really happend other than Joshua saying words that I didn't understand, and I pretended that I had everything under-control. But, on my third day 
        of work, he found out I liked to bike and I found out he printed a conference poster with a single red period on it (not like I would poke fun at him or anything over that).
        Our friend Andrea very causually asked if I wanted to go see the bike room with them and on the way out, Andrea left us and Joshua asked me if I wanted to bike with them one day that week. He then asked for my 
        phone number so he could "create a group chat" for the bike ride. Yes, he is that smooth, never let him convince you otherwise.

      <h2>Our Adventures</h2>
      <p>Ever since that day, we have shared adventures big and small: biking in the rain, backpacking in national parks, walking around Winston-Salem, and long road trips. Each one has been full of laughter and the joy of exploring new places together.</p>

      <h2>The Proposal</h2>
      <p>On a serene beach at sunset…just kidding. The ring? Handed to me in bed. The mountain photos? A 4-mile hike the next day, purely for appearances. Not like anyone would expect anything different from us. </p>
